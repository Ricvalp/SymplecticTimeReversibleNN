# SymplecticTimeReversibleNN

### Time-reversible neural networks for learning (Hamiltonian) dynamical systems.

### Four systems are used in the experiments: The Poincare' map of the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian system for three different values of energy, the Poincare' map of the perturbed simple pendulum, and two 3-dimensional, systems that are not Hamiltonian but are reversible with respect to two different reversing symmetries. The repository contains three folders with the experiments, one with the results, and a folder with the methods used in the scripts.

The scripts SympNets.py, HenonMaps.py, RealNVP.py, and NeuralNetwork.py import .txt files generated by DatasetGenerator.ipynb using the Julia language. The Python scripts do not require Julia.
