# SymplecticTimeReversibleNN
### Time-reversible neural networks for learning Hamiltonian systems.

### Two systems are implemented: The Poincare' map of the Henon-Heiles Hamiltonian system for three different values of energy, and the Poincare' map of the perturbed simple pendulum.

In each folder there is a dataset generator that generates .txt files using Julia. The dataset are then imported and used in the other notebooks that do not require Julia.
